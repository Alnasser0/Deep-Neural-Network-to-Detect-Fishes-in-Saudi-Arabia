# A Lightweight Neural Network for Real-Time Fish Detection in Saudi Arabia

## üêü Introduction

This project addresses a growing need in Saudi Arabia‚Äôs fish market. With many unique species that inhabit only the Gulf and Red Seas, customers often struggle to identify fish ‚Äî especially younger buyers unfamiliar with local names or appearances.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Many fish in Saudi markets have subtle visual differences, making manual identification difficult without prior knowledge. Variations in shape, size, color, and texture make this a visually challenging task. Given this, a deep learning-based image classifier, particularly a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), is ideal for recognizing fish based on their distinctive features.

## üí° Proposed Solution

I developed a real-time fish species detection model using TensorFlow‚Äôs Object Detection API. This model leverages lightweight architectures (e.g., MobileNet, Mobile DetNet) for efficient deployment on mobile devices. It aims to help customers instantly recognize fish species at the point of sale.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Design

- **Data Collection**: Aggregated from search engines, social media, and domain experts.
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Labeled and boxed images manually.
  - Resized and validated images for training.
  - Balanced: each class contains 100‚Äì300 images.
- **Dataset Split**: 90% training, 10% validation.
- **Framework**: TensorFlow Object Detection API.
